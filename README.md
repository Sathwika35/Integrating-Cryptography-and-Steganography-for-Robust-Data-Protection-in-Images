# Integrating-Cryptography-and-Steganography-for-Robust-Data-Protection-in-Images
Developed a secure data protection system by integrating cryptography and steganography, termed Crystography. Messages are first encrypted with a symmetric key and then embedded in images using a novel 3-3-2 LSB technique. The system ensures confidentiality, imperceptibility, and robustness against attacks
